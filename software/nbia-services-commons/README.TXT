The classes in this project should roughly be thought of as the business logic.  
This can sort of be considered a dumping ground for anything that isn't a basic utility, 
grid related, or presentation related.

DO NOT put any data access stuff in here.  That should go in nbia-dao or some
data access focused project/deployment unit.
