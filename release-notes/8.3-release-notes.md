The following are the major changes for the NBIA at TCIA 8.3 release:

<ul>
<li>The Cine mode view of series available in the Data Admin module now opens outside of the browser window. This allows curators to expand the Cine mode window to fit their screen.
<li>The REST API has been updated. Two APIs have new endpoints, as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>The getSeries API has two new endpoints, LicenseName and LicenseURI.
    <li>The getSeriesMetaData2 API, which is an Advanced API, now returns the same endpoints as the getSeriesMetaData API, which is a Search API. The additional endpoints let you submit a list of UIDs in a single API call.
  </ul>
<li>Previously undocumented query parameters and return values have been added to the [NBIA Search REST API Guide]|(https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/NBIA+Search+REST+API+Guide) and [NBIA Search with Authentication REST API Guide]|(https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/NBIA+Search+with+Authentication+REST+API+Guide). The following API endpoints were updated: getContentsbyName, NewStudiesInPatientCollection, getPatientStudy, getSeries, getSeriesMetaData, and getUpdatedSeries.
</ul>
